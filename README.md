WiCS: Calculator
===

a simple js calculator.

### Week 1: Intro to HTML (2/7)
* Relationship between HTML, CSS, and Javascript
	* HTML: bare-bones content, markup
	* CSS: pretty-fying 
	* Javascript: adding functionality
* HTML ids and classes
	* id: unique
	* class: not unique
	* [for a better explanation on how they are different](http://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/)
	* used for organization of elements, styling, and functionality

### Week 2: Displaying the calculator (2/21)

####Exercise 1:
* Make a webpage that displays 3 boxes in a line (one green, one yellow, and one red).
* HINT: use `<div>`s and keep your CSS in a different file than your HTML! Code snippet for that is below.

####Calculator Display: 
* Picture of what it should look like in models/paper.png
* Button tags
	* `<button>TEXT</button>`
* Organizing our elements (varies)
	* Divide each row by `<div class="row">`s 
	* Assigning classes and values to `<button>`s 
* Styling (make it pretty!)
* Always put your CSS in a different file, then reference it from your HTML
	* `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">`
